There will be 3 practise questions available in the link below.
Take your time and solve the problems.
Submit and let me know once you are done with the practise codes.

Each code requires a little more thinking than what you do now.
Think and solve.
Most of them are easy and check for the explanation at the bottom for easy understanding of the code.
