Money : 69

normal solution : 				count of coins
69 - 1's 											 69
34 - 2's, 1 - 1's									 35
13 - 5's, 2 - 2's									 15
6 - 10's, 1 - 5's, 2 - 2's				  		  9
3 - 20's, 1 - 5's, 2 - 2's     			  	  6

Find the one which can be calculated with least number of coins.
Last one with 6 coins leads to the optimal solution among all others.

Instead of checking every other possibility, Greedy Algorithm will find the best and optimal solution at the beginning and saves the time.
