In Java, we have built-in methods inside the class String 

** length()						: used to find the length of the string
** contains()						: used to check if any sequence/char is present in it 
** compareTo()				: compares two string values and returns, -1, 1 and 0 
** replace()						: replaces the target value with a new value
** equals()						: checks if two strings are exactly equal
** equalsIgnorecase()		: checks if two strings are equal, no need of case
** charAt()						: used to access a specific char in String using Index
** trim()							: used to eliminate spaces (before and after the String)
** isEmpty()						: checks if the String is empty or not
** toUpperCase()				: converts to UpperCase
** toLowerCase()				: converts to LowerCase
** substring() 					: take a part of String and works in 2 ways
