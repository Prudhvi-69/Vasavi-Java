Arithmatic 
		Binary : +,-,*,/,%
		Unary : ++, --
Comparison / Relational : <, >, ==, <=,>=, !=
Assignment : =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %= 
Bitwise : &, |, <<, ^ , >>, ~, ! 
Logical : &&, || 
Ternary : (condition) ? (true block) : (false block)

Bitwise : These operators will follow a process for every input.					&, |, ^, <<, >>, ~ 
69 & 42 
Steps 
1. Consider the values and identify the operator
2. Convert the values into Binary 
3. Perform the operation
4. You'll get the result in Binary
5. Convert the result into OG format.
