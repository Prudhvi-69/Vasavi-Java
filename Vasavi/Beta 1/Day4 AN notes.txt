LinkedList : 
For insertions : 
add(value)						: inserts a value to the list
add(index, value)			: inserts a value at specific index
addFirst(value)				: inserts a value at 0th index (First ele)
addLast(value)				: inserts a value at last index

For deleting : 
remove(index);				-> points to index, and will delete it 
removeFirst();  				-> points to, 1st value and vl delete it
removeLast();				-> points to, last value and vl delete it

For accessing :
get(index) :	access an element in the linked list 
getFirst()  : access the first element in the list
getLast()  : access the last element in the list

** LinkedList is faster for insertion and deletions in Jaba
** ArrayList is faster when it comes to accessing the elements in the list
** LinkedList will provide few extra methods as it is just an extention in
