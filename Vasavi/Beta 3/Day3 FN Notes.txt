Abstract Methods : It is a method which will have no implementation when it is first created.

** You can write your own implementation when you are using it somwhere else in any other class.





try block: we write the code which we think will give us the Exception and if it gives any error, it will be handled by its sibling, called, catch() block.

catch block () : it is going be executed only when there is an exception and will make the program work even when there are errors and exceptions.

finally : this is a block of code, which is going to be executed when there is exception and even when there is no exception...
** It will work everytime irrespective of the code and errors......


** Exception handling will provide the support to make the programs work even in uneven situations......
