Each one have one System

We will be doing simultaneously in your systems and in mine.

Or we do one thing, I do first, you do next.

But be sure to do something in the system related to the class but not anything else........................................








Operators : 

Arithmetic  
		|-------- Binary 		: +, -, * , /, % 
		|-------- Unary   	: ++, --
 
Comparison / Relational  : <, >, ==, !=, <=, >= 
Logical 								: &&, ||, ! 
Bitwise								: <<, >>, &, |, ~ (Complement) 
Assignment 						: =, +=, -=, *= , /=, %= 
Ternary 								: ( Condition ) ? (If true) : (if false) ;  




Bitwise Ops : 

Steps : 

1. Consider two values and the bitwise operator
2. Convert the values into Binary  
3. Identify the operator
4. Perform the operation
5. You will get the result in Binary
6. Convert the result into OG format.

1. 4 & 9 					: 0
2. 11 & 21				: 1
3. 2 | 10					: 10 
4. 2 | 11					: 11
5. 3 << 2					: 12
6. 3 >> 2 				: 0 
7. 69 << 4           : 
8. 69 >> 4 				:






0010
1011
1011 = 11

1010 = 10
0111 = 7
1111 = 15

3 << 2	
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0011
<< : Shift bits left 

0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1100 = 12

3 >> 2
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0011

>> : Shift bits to the right 

0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001

0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 = 0 














<< : It shifts bits to its left..


Final : It is used to make anything constant/stable/ fixed.

For variable : It will make the variable constant and unchanging.
For method : It will make the method non-overriding
For class : It will make the class non-inheriting.

Static : It is used to make anything related to class or belong to the class directly without the need of any OBJECT......

variable : A static variable doesn't need any object to use it and default value in it will be 0 / null.

method : To call a static method, you don't need to create any object, you call it directly with the name of the class.

Just let me know how many SHEEEPS are here......

One SHEEP starts talking, other one continues the same.....

Good SHEEPS..... Bad SHEEPS.....
VERY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD.......
